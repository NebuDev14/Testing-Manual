### What is SysID?
#### 
    SysID is a built in feature in wpilib that allows us to get values for PID and Feedforward loops and is one of the first things you have to learn about when learning about control theory in robotics.This As it is what allows us to effectively tune PID and SVA values. For more information on PID and SVA values check [insert link when made] and [insert link when made].

### How does SysID work?

#### 
    SysID works by deploying code made by the people behind wpilib that allows you to run tests on your robot and collect data about your robot mechanism. SysID also includes code that allows you to analyze this data where you get your PID and SVA values/
